# Observations

1. Million was able to render 1M items successfully.
1. Let alone 1M items, React failed to render even 100K items. Yes, browser threw **_page not responsive_** ðŸ’€ (tried both, chrome and firefox)

### I guess now we know why it was named Million :)

# Conclusion

1. Million+react is definitely faster & better than plain React in this case.

# Try it yourself

-   ## start million-react by doing

```
cd million-react
